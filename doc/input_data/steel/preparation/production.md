## Steel Production

Steel production is the main datasource of the SIMSON steel model. As it is the only primary steel data source, where
data as far back as 1900 is available, it is also used to extrapolate other datasets back to the past. We prepare two
different datasets for SIMSON, one for regional crude steel production in general (dimensions historical time and
region) and one with the added dimension intermediate steel production, that can be used better to model tramp elements.
Hence, the data preparation described here is split into two parts.
