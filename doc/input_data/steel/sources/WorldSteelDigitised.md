## World Steel Digitised

The World Steel Digitised dataset refers to digitised data from the World Steel Association's (WSA) Steel Statistical
Yearbooks, published from 1978 until 2022. These datasets used to be freely available over the
WSA's [website](https://worldsteel.org) and some still are available on the internet. For PIK internal use, they are
stored in the cluster.

The yearbooks offer an extensive collection of various datasets relevant to the steel industry. Each contains dozens of
tables, usually with country specific data for the last ten years. However, the yearbooks do not all provide the same
datasets, the included data is frequently changed. A comprehensive overview of which yearbooks contain which data is
provided in [this Excel sheet](./Yearbook_Contents.xlsx).

So far (April 2025) we have digitised data from the following datasets, usually from various yearbooks,
country specific unless stated otherwise:

- Crude Steel Production
    - **From 1969 - 2009**
    - **World total from 1900 - 1979**
- Production by process
    - **Each year individually from 1974-1981**
    - **BOF production 1982-2001**
    - **EAF production 1982-2001**
- Indirect trade by category (still country specific)
    - **Imports 2013**
    - **Exports 2013**
- Scrap Trade
    - **Imports 1971 - 2010**
    - **Exports 1971 - 2010**
- Scrap Consumption (the scrap used in steel production)
    - **From 1975 - 1998**
    - **Just for 2004**
    - **As share of production for 1965 & 1970 & 1974 - 1979**
