## GDP

Gross domestic product (GDP) data is mainly taken from
[this Koch and Leimbach paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4011838).
It provides country specific GDP projections and historic data from 1965 until 2150 for each of the five
SSP scenarios.

To get a dataset that reaches back to 1900, the data is ammended with OECD 1900-1950 data.
