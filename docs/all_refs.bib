	abstract = {Abstract. Global production of cement has grown very rapidly in
recent years, and, after fossil fuels and land-use change, it is the
third-largest source of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The
availability of the required data for estimating emissions from global
cement production is poor, and it has been recognised that some global
estimates are significantly inflated. This article assembles a large variety
of available datasets, prioritising official data and emission factors,
including estimates submitted to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), plus new estimates for China and
India, to present a new analysis of global process emissions from cement
production. Global process emissions in 2018 were 1.50±0.12 Gt CO2, equivalent to about 4 \% of emissions from fossil fuels.
Cumulative emissions from 1928 to 2018 were 38.3±2.4 Gt CO2,
71 \% of which have occurred since 1990. The data associated with this
article can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.831454

	abstract = {Background: Income has been extensively studied and utilized as a determinant of health. There are several sources of income expressed as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, but there are no time series that are complete for the years between 1950 and 2015 for the 210 countries for which data exist. It is in the interest of population health research to establish a global time series that is complete from 1950 to 2015.
Methods: We collected GDP per capita estimates expressed in either constant US dollar terms or international dollar terms (corrected for purchasing power parity) from seven sources. We applied several stages of models, including ordinary least-squares regressions and mixed effects models, to complete each of the seven source series from 1950 to 2015. The three US dollar and four international dollar series were each averaged to produce two new GDP per capita series.
Results and discussion: Nine complete series from 1950 to 2015 for 210 countries are available for use. These series can serve various analytical purposes and can illustrate myriad economic trends and features. The derivation of the two new series allows for researchers to avoid any series-specific biases that may exist. The modeling approach used is flexible and will allow for yearly updating as new estimates are produced by the source series.
Conclusion: GDP per capita is a necessary tool in population health research, and our development and implementation of a new method has allowed for the most comprehensive known time series to date.},

	abstract = {Long-term economic scenarios (up to 2100) are needed as a basis to explore possible different futures for major environmental challenges, including climate change. Given the high level of uncertainty involved, such scenarios would need to span a wide range of possible growth trajectories. The recently developed storylines of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) provide a basis for making such projections. This paper describes a consistent methodology to derive (per capita) GDP trend pathways on a country basis. The methodology is based on a convergence process and places emphasis on the key drivers of economic growth in the long run: population, total factor productivity, physical capital, employment and human capital, and energy and fossil fuel resources (specifically oil and gas). The paper uses this methodology to derive country-level economic growth projections for 184 countries. The paper also investigates the influence of short-term growth rate estimates on the long-term income levels in various countries. It does so by comparing long-term projections based on short-term forecasts from 2011 with the projections based on forecasts from 2013. This highlights the effects of the recent economic crisis and uncertainty in short term developments on longer term growth trends. The projections are subject to large uncertainties, particularly for the later decades, and disregard a wide range of country-specific drivers of economic growth that are outside the narrow economic framework, such as external shocks, governance barriers and feedbacks from environmental damage. Hence, they should be interpreted with sufficient care and not be treated as predictions.},

Short Abstract

We update the population and human capital components of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) at the global level, considering the most recent baseline information. While the long-term assumptions based on extensive analysis and expert solicitations remain unchanged, we modify only the trend component. The first set of SSPs was based on demographic data through 2012. The population structures by age, sex, and education of the base year (2010) have since changed for most countries, mainly due to more recent data and reliable information. The mortality situation has improved in many countries affected by HIV/AIDS and among children in countries with higher mortality. The impact of COVID-19 on demographic trends must be addressed. In many countries, fertility rates have fallen faster than expected. International migration has been irregular and volatile as usual. These changes are reflected in the new update, with some improvements in operationalization.

Changes in version "V14":

 We found a bug affecting the education distribution sex (interchanged) in 37 countries (with UN country code): 32 Argentina, 44 Bahamas, 48 Bahrain, 64 Bhutan, 76 Brazil, 108 Burundi, 132 Cabo Verde, 156 China, 158 China, Taiwan Province of China, 170 Colombia, 214 Dominican Republic, 218 Ecuador, 226 Equatorial Guinea, 288 Ghana, 296 Kiribati, 360 Indonesia, 392 Japan, 400 Jordan, 410 Republic of Korea, 414 Kuwait, 496 Mongolia, 528 Netherlands, 558 Nicaragua, 583 Micronesia (Fed.

            Plastics have outgrown most man-made materials and have long been under environmental scrutiny. However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9\% of which had been recycled, 12\% was incinerated, and 79\% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

	abstract = {Plastics have a broad range of use, but also bring about a variety of environmental implications. China is the world's largest producer and user of plastics, accounting for nearly one-third of the total global flow. Investigating plastic production and use in China is thus critical for developing solutions to promote material circularity and to minimize environmental impacts. We examined five categories of plastics—polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)—which together contribute 74\% of China's total primary plastic consumption. We employed a dynamic model to quantify the material stocks and flows of these five plastics from 1978-2017. The results show that the annual use of these five major plastics increased dramatically from 1 million ton/annual (Mt/a, equivalent to 1 kg/capita) in 1978 to 63 Mt/a (46 kg/capita) in 2017. The in-use plastic stocks were estimated at 305 Mt (219 kg/capita) as of 2017, with 60\% in building and construction sectors. The rapid increase in plastic use generated substantial post-consumer waste flows up to 44 Mt/a in 2017, out of which 26 Mt/a was packaging waste. Over the past 40 years, 29\% of the plastic waste was recycled to produce secondary materials, in comparison to 12\% incinerated, 42\% landfilled, and 17\% discarded without any proper treatment. Policy implications for enhancing plastic recycling are discussed.},

	abstract = {The first step towards resource sustainability is quantifying the relationship between material flow and stock. Dynamic material flow analysis (dMFA) bridges the gap between stock and flow due to its distinct advantages, and researchers have employed it extensively since the 21st century. However, the development process and characteristics of dMFA are still unclear, and the main application and hotspot application of dMFA are also poorly understood. By reviewing 369 publications, content analysis was used to elaborate on dMFA development history, application progress and future directions from a comprehensive perspective. The results show that dMFA studies present a multi-perspective, multi-object, and multi-scale development trend, which mainly include two main contents: spatial–temporal simulation and evaluation. Spatial-temporal simulation studies, especially time evolution (including past and future) studies, are a hot spot for dMFA, while spatial identification studies are less common and focused mostly on the urban scale, which is an important direction for future development. At the same time, dMFA evaluation is also a research hotspot. Based on dMFA, metabolic characteristics can be evaluated, and by applying other methods such as life cycle assessment, decoupling analysis, system dynamics, risk assessment techniques, and multi-criteria decision analysis, social, economic, and environmental concerns associated with material flows are also evaluated. This review highlights the method's direction of development and application and is helpful for dMFA development. Future research should unify accounting systems, improve the accounting framework, expand the database, and integrate multiple methods to enhance the intersection and application of dMFA.},

Current socioeconomic metabolism research traces flows of energy, materials or substances to capture resource use: input of raw materials or energy, their fate in production and consumption, and the discharge of wastes and emissions. This approach has yielded important insights into eco-efficiency and long-term drivers of resource use. But socio-metabolic research has not yet fully incorporated material stocks or their services, hence not completely exploiting the analytic power of the metabolism concept. This commentary argues for a material stock–flow–service nexus approach focused on the analysis of interrelations between material and energy flows, socioeconomic material stocks (“in-use stocks of materials”) and the services provided by specific stock/flow combinations. Analyzing the interrelations between stocks, flows and services will allow researchers to develop highly innovative indicators of eco-efficiency and open new research directions that will help to better understand biophysical foundations of transformations towards sustainability.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development involves a responsible management of the interactions between humans and their built and natural environment. From a physical perspective, the interactions can be characterized as stocks and flows of energy and matter within and between these spheres. Understanding the dynamics of the stocks is essential to enable their responsible management. A large number of independent disciplines study the dynamics of individual stocks with specific methods. The resulting fragmentation of methods hampers interdisciplinary learning, including the integration of more specialized discipline-specific models into more encompassing ones. Here, we develop a general mathematical framework for dynamic stock models based on balance, intrinsic, and model-approach equations. We use the framework to classify a variety of stock models from different disciplines and discuss their applicability. The framework provides a common language for the interdisciplinary analysis of coupled human–environment systems.

	abstract = {Steel production accounts for 25\% of industrial carbon emissions. Long-term forecasts of steel demand and scrap supply are needed to develop strategies for how the steel industry could respond to industrialization and urbanization in the developing world while simultaneously reducing its environmental impact, and in particular, its carbon footprint. We developed a dynamic stock model to estimate future final demand for steel and the available scrap for 10 world regions. Based on evidence from developed countries, we assumed that per capita in-use stocks will saturate eventually. We determined the response of the entire steel cycle to stock saturation, in particular the future split between primary and secondary steel production. During the 21st century, steel demand may peak in the developed world, China, the Middle East, Latin America, and India. As China completes its industrialization, global primary steel production may peak between 2020 and 2030 and decline thereafter. We developed a capacity model to show how extensive trade of finished steel could prolong the lifetime of the Chinese steelmaking assets. Secondary steel production will more than double by 2050, and it may surpass primary production between 2050 and 2060: the late 21st century can become the steel scrap age.},

	abstract = {As the world’s largest CO2 emitter and steel producer, China has set the ambitious goal of establishing a circular economy which aims at reconciling economic development with environmental protection and sustainable resource use. This work applies dynamic material flow analysis to forecast production, recycling, and iron ore consumption in the Chinese steel cycle until 2100 by using steel services in terms of in-use stock per capita as driver of future development. The whole cycle is modeled to determine possible responses of the steel industry in light of the circular economy concept. If per-capita stock saturates at 8–12 tons as evidence from industrialized countries suggests, consumption may peak between 2015 and 2020, whereupon it is likely to drop by up to 40\% until 2050. A slower growing in-use stock could mitigate this peak and hence reduce overcapacity in primary production. Old scrap supply will increase substantially and it could replace up to 80\% of iron ore as resource for steel making by 2050. This would require advanced recycling technologies as manufacturers of machinery and transportation equipment would have to shift to secondary steel as well as new capacities in secondary production which could, however, make redundant already existing integrated steel plants.},

            Material flow analysis (MFA) studies the stocks and flows of goods and substances in systems. The methods and algorithms of MFA have improved over the last few years, but a flexible platform that integrates recent modeling advances such as simultaneous consideration of the product, component, material and chemical element levels, lifetime models, and uncertainty treatment is not available. There is also no versatile data format for exchanging data between projects. This lack of research infrastructure is detrimental to scientific progress. To fill that gap, we propose a novel industrial ecology community model for MFA. The Open Dynamic Material Systems Model (ODYM) is an open source framework for material systems modeling programmed in Python. The description of systems, processes, stocks, flows, and parameters is object‐based, which facilitates the development of modular software and testing routines for individual model blocks. ODYM MFA models can handle any depth of flow and stock specification: products, components, sub‐components, materials, alloys, waste, and chemical elements can be traced simultaneously. ODYM features a new data structure for material flow analysis; all input and output data are stored in a standardized file format and can thus be exchanged across projects. It also comes with an extended library for dynamic stock modeling. We present the features, design principles, software, and data structure of ODYM, describe its main methods and functions, and give an outlook on current and future applications.},
