# REMIND-MFA in the context of the TRANSIENCE project

The REMIND-MFA is planned to be one module in a larger framework developed within the [TRANSIENCE](https://www.transience.eu/) (TRANSItioning towards an Efficient, carbon-Neutral Circular European industry) project. The integrated modelling framework MIC3 (Model for European Industry Circularity and Climate Change Mitigation) will explore decarbonisation pathways and circular economy strategies for the European industry.   
As a global MFA module, the primary purpose of REMIND-MFA is to provide the international context essential for evaluating material production, trade, and demand flows — particularly relevant for materials such as steel and plastics, whose supply chains are heavily globalised and trade-intensive.   
Given the highly international nature of the basic material sectors, analysing their transformation cannot be effectively undertaken without a robust global perspective. Within the MIC3 framework, REMIND-MFA addresses this need by delivering a consistent representation of global material trade flows, including those across EU borders.
