# Input data
Input data is originally stored in its unedited, raw form. It is then processed with the [mrmfa package](https://github.com/pik-piam/mrmfa) specifically developed for data preprocessing for the REMIND MFA [@mrmfa]. The package consists of R scripts which bring the raw data into the form that is used by the MFA. This includes, for example, combining different data sources into one set, filling regional gaps, interpolating in time if necessary, and formatting. The mrmfa package builds on the [madrat package](https://github.com/pik-piam/madrat) [@madrat], a package for transparent and reproducible input data processing developed by PIK. It takes the regional resolution as an input parameter, such that different resolutions and scopes can be used in the future.
