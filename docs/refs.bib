	abstract = {The first step towards resource sustainability is quantifying the relationship between material flow and stock. Dynamic material flow analysis (dMFA) bridges the gap between stock and flow due to its distinct advantages, and researchers have employed it extensively since the 21st century. However, the development process and characteristics of dMFA are still unclear, and the main application and hotspot application of dMFA are also poorly understood. By reviewing 369 publications, content analysis was used to elaborate on dMFA development history, application progress and future directions from a comprehensive perspective. The results show that dMFA studies present a multi-perspective, multi-object, and multi-scale development trend, which mainly include two main contents: spatial–temporal simulation and evaluation. Spatial-temporal simulation studies, especially time evolution (including past and future) studies, are a hot spot for dMFA, while spatial identification studies are less common and focused mostly on the urban scale, which is an important direction for future development. At the same time, dMFA evaluation is also a research hotspot. Based on dMFA, metabolic characteristics can be evaluated, and by applying other methods such as life cycle assessment, decoupling analysis, system dynamics, risk assessment techniques, and multi-criteria decision analysis, social, economic, and environmental concerns associated with material flows are also evaluated. This review highlights the method's direction of development and application and is helpful for dMFA development. Future research should unify accounting systems, improve the accounting framework, expand the database, and integrate multiple methods to enhance the intersection and application of dMFA.},

	abstract = {Fundamental changes in the societal use of biophysical resources are required for a sustainability transformation. Current socioeconomic metabolism research traces flows of energy, materials or substances to capture resource use: input of raw materials or energy, their fate in production and consumption, and the discharge of wastes and emissions. This approach has yielded important insights into eco-efficiency and long-term drivers of resource use. But socio-metabolic research has not yet fully incorporated material stocks or their services, hence not completely exploiting the analytic power of the metabolism concept. This commentary argues for a material stock–flow–service nexus approach focused on the analysis of interrelations between material and energy flows, socioeconomic material stocks (“in-use stocks of materials”) and the services provided by specific stock/flow combinations. Analyzing the interrelations between stocks, flows and services will allow researchers to develop highly innovative indicators of eco-efficiency and open new research directions that will help to better understand biophysical foundations of transformations towards sustainability.},

From a physical perspective, the interactions can be characterized as stocks and flows of energy and matter within and between these spheres. Understanding the dynamics of the stocks is essential to enable their responsible management. A large number of independent disciplines study the dynamics of individual stocks with specific methods. The resulting fragmentation of methods hampers interdisciplinary learning, including the integration of more specialized discipline-specific models into more encompassing ones. Here, we develop a general mathematical framework for dynamic stock models based on balance, intrinsic, and model-approach equations. We use the framework to classify a variety of stock models from different disciplines and discuss their applicability. The framework provides a common language for the interdisciplinary analysis of coupled human–environment systems.

Long-term forecasts of steel demand and scrap supply are needed to develop strategies for how the steel industry could respond to industrialization and urbanization in the developing world while simultaneously reducing its environmental impact, and in particular, its carbon footprint. We developed a dynamic stock model to estimate future final demand for steel and the available scrap for 10 world regions. Based on evidence from developed countries, we assumed that per capita in-use stocks will saturate eventually. We determined the response of the entire steel cycle to stock saturation, in particular the future split between primary and secondary steel production. During the 21st century, steel demand may peak in the developed world, China, the Middle East, Latin America, and India. As China completes its industrialization, global primary steel production may peak between 2020 and 2030 and decline thereafter. We developed a capacity model to show how extensive trade of finished steel could prolong the lifetime of the Chinese steelmaking assets. Secondary steel production will more than double by 2050, and it may surpass primary production between 2050 and 2060: the late 21st century can become the steel scrap age.},

This work applies dynamic material flow analysis to forecast production, recycling, and iron ore consumption in the Chinese steel cycle until 2100 by using steel services in terms of in-use stock per capita as driver of future development. The whole cycle is modeled to determine possible responses of the steel industry in light of the circular economy concept. If per-capita stock saturates at 8–12 tons as evidence from industrialized countries suggests, consumption may peak between 2015 and 2020, whereupon it is likely to drop by up to 40\% until 2050. A slower growing in-use stock could mitigate this peak and hence reduce overcapacity in primary production. Old scrap supply will increase substantially and it could replace up to 80\% of iron ore as resource for steel making by 2050. This would require advanced recycling technologies as manufacturers of machinery and transportation equipment would have to shift to secondary steel as well as new capacities in secondary production which could, however, make redundant already existing integrated steel plants.},

            Material flow analysis (MFA) studies the stocks and flows of goods and substances in systems. The methods and algorithms of MFA have improved over the last few years, but a flexible platform that integrates recent modeling advances such as simultaneous consideration of the product, component, material and chemical element levels, lifetime models, and uncertainty treatment is not available. There is also no versatile data format for exchanging data between projects. This lack of research infrastructure is detrimental to scientific progress. To fill that gap, we propose a novel industrial ecology community model for MFA. The Open Dynamic Material Systems Model (ODYM) is an open source framework for material systems modeling programmed in Python. The description of systems, processes, stocks, flows, and parameters is object‐based, which facilitates the development of modular software and testing routines for individual model blocks. ODYM MFA models can handle any depth of flow and stock specification: products, components, sub‐components, materials, alloys, waste, and chemical elements can be traced simultaneously. ODYM features a new data structure for material flow analysis; all input and output data are stored in a standardized file format and can thus be exchanged across projects. It also comes with an extended library for dynamic stock modeling. We present the features, design principles, software, and data structure of ODYM, describe its main methods and functions, and give an outlook on current and future applications.},
