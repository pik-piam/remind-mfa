Here, we overwrite recent historic GDP per capita by extrapolating back from 2025 using the growth rates after 2025. This creates continuity between the recent historic GDP growth used for the gaussian correction and the future assumed growth rates and thereby prevents discontinuities in production. | remind_mfa\common\stock_extrapolation.py |           148 |     nan |          |
